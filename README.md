# Boruvka-s-Algorithm
here we Notebook implements **Borůvka’s algorithm** for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. It iteratively merges graph components with the minimum edge between them until a connected MST or forest is formed. OpenMP parallelization is used to improve performance in handling large graphs.
